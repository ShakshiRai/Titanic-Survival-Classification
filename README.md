This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on various factors such as age, gender, ticket class, and fare. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes demographic and travel-related information about the passengers.

The workflow involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation to achieve a high-accuracy survival prediction. The final model is assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure its effectiveness.

The repository includes well-structured code for data cleaning, model training, and performance analysis, making it easy to understand and extend for further experimentation.
